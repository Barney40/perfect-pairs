browser not refreshing - css styling not applied

Browsers often store bits of code to help pages load faster (this process is known as caching). It's great for deployed websites because their CSS isn't likely to change, but for development purposes, it can cause issues.

﻿Try clearing your cache by doing the following:
Open up Developer Tools:
either: right-clicking the page and click 'inspect'
or: press the F12 button

Click and Hold down the Reload button. A drop down should appear, then click 'Empty Cache and Hard Reload'.
